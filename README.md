# Juhee's Portfolio Website

Hello—it's great to e-meet you! 

Please see my live React app portfolio through this link: https://juheehong11.github.io/juheehong_portfolio/ 

I try to update the website as frequently as possible, but should there be any differences between what's on this website and my submitted resume, 
please refer to the resume submitted to your company as it will contain the more up-to-date information.

Also, there might be a few bugs due to some of the changes I make from time to time, but I try to get them fixed as soon as possible.
(Currently I think the website might have a bit of a responsive web design issue on mobile phones & I apologize for the inconvnience—I'm working to fix it!)
